# üåÄ CoreSelf System

## Overview

The **CoreSelf** is the radiant center of *Emergent*‚Äîthe symbolic anchor of identity and the mechanical heart of the gameplay loop. It does not move of its own volition; it evolves, transforms, and pulses in response to the player's choices, emotional state, and internal growth.

---

## üåü Narrative Symbolism

- Represents **inner identity**‚Äîthe stable "self" within chaos.
- Grows not by movement, but by resonance with the player's Consciousness.
- Reflects emotional health, accumulated insight, and spiritual scars.
- Its form tells the story of who the player has become.

## üî¢ Core Attributes

| Stat      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Clarity** | Mental focus and lucidity. Increases with positive fragments and modules. |
| **Stress** | Emotional strain. Builds from chaos, trauma, or unresolved Echo. |
| **Echo**   | Lingering residue of unprocessed experience. Amplifies instability. |

- **Resilience** is a derived trait, increasing the CoreSelf‚Äôs ability to endure Stress.
- These stats define the CoreSelf‚Äôs ability to process fragments, withstand intrusions, and grow.

## üéÆ Functional Mechanics

### Anchoring

- The CoreSelf can be **teleported** to new stable nodes via the Anchor ability.
- Only **stable MindNodes** can receive the CoreSelf.
- Anchoring re-centers the player's exploration and extends the range of interaction.

### Module Orbit

- Modules acquired through synthesis **orbit the CoreSelf**.
- Types include:
  - **Clarity Modules**: Increase max Clarity.
  - **Resilience Modules**: Raise Stress threshold or reduce Stress gain.
  - **Insight Modules**: Unlock unique traits, narrative shifts, or endgame modifiers.

### Visual Feedback

- Grows brighter, more complex with progression.
- Scarred or flickering when damaged (e.g., post-collapse).
- May bloom, distort, or glow differently based on emotional load.

## üß¨ Growth & Evolution

### Visual States

| State         | Visual Effect |
|---------------|---------------|
| Calm          | Gentle glow, clear patterns |
| High Stress   | Red cracks, trembling light |
| High Clarity  | Radiant aura, harmonic pulses |
| Collapse      | Dimming, fragment loss visual |
| Meta-Synthesis | Mandala bloom, temporal shimmer |

### Emotional Influence

- Clarity passively reduces Stress over time.
- High Echo increases vulnerability to Intrusions.
- Meditation or Synthesis rebalances the system.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Collapse & Recovery

### Collapse Trigger

- Occurs if Intrusion fails or emotional state exceeds safe limits.
- CoreSelf shatters temporarily; player loses unsynthesized fragments.
- Resets position to last stable node.

### Recovery

- Stress partially reset (~70% of threshold).
- Clarity lowered.
- Visuals and audio indicate disorientation.
- Modules remain intact (growth is never fully lost).

## üß† Symbolic Role

The CoreSelf is:

- A mirror of the soul.
- A gameplay checkpoint.
- A poetic journal of progress.

What the player carries around it, reflects in it, and connects to it becomes the legacy of their consciousness.

---

## üõ† Technical Notes

- Represented in code as a persistent world object.
- Stores global emotional states, module references, and node location.
- Updates real-time in response to fragments, intrusions, and player focus.
- UI elements tied directly to CoreSelf status (Clarity/Stress bars, orbiting modules).

---

## üîÆ Future Mechanics

- **Form Evolution**: CoreSelf morphs in structure based on archetype and burden.
- **Memory Veins**: Fragments leave trails leading to zones of origin.
- **Synaptic Bloom**: Late-game mechanic that allows CoreSelf to pulse new zones into being.

---

The CoreSelf does not act‚Äîit **responds**. It does not run‚Äîit **endures**.  
It is the sacred center, waiting to be remade by the will of the evolving mind.
