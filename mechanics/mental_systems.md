# Mental Systems Framework

In *Emergent*, the player's abilities and experiences are structured through a layered cognitive system. These systems reflect the growth of consciousness, patterns of thought, and symbolic evolution.

## ðŸŒŒ System Overview

### 1. **Mental Objects**
Representations of memory, emotion, imagination, or philosophical insight. All mental interaction begins here.

- Symbolic entities in the world.
- Mutable, evolving, and responsive to attention, emotion, and intent.

---

### 2. **Mental Skills**
Active cognitive tools used to interact with Mental Objects and the environment.

- Triggered intentionally by the player.
- Often situational, requiring awareness and choice.
- Examples: Attune, Let Go, Reflect.

---

### 3. **Protocols**
Passive cognitive patternsâ€”learned instincts, unconscious habits, and background processes.

- Always active once unlocked.
- Can stack, evolve, or conflict.
- Often shape the outcome of interactions without direct input.

---

### 4. **Threads**
Narrative and emotional connections between objects, actions, or experiences.

- Woven manually or emerge through play.
- Can decay, strengthen, or transform.
- Enable thematic synthesis and deep memory effects.

---

### 5. **Cortex Interface**
The symbolic UI that displays and manages all mental systems.

- Can appear as a neural web, mandala, or fragmented mind map.
- Interactive and responsive to progression and player archetype.
- Unlocks new abilities and insight over time.

## ðŸ§  Design Philosophy

These systems are not merely mechanical. They reflect how the self evolves through interaction with inner content. The layering of active, passive, and relational systems creates a depth of cognition that players shape over time.

- **Mental Objects** = What the mind holds.
- **Mental Skills** = What the mind does.
- **Protocols** = How the mind *defaults*.
- **Threads** = Why and how meaning connects.
- **Cortex** = Where self-awareness is mapped.

---

## ðŸ§ª Implementation Notes

- Each system is modular and expandable.
- Skills and Protocols can be bound to Fragments or Intrusions.
- Threads may evolve into unique synthesis triggers, memories, or transformation events.

Future additions:
- Thread-based puzzles or lock systems
- Protocol conflicts and overloads
- Custom Cortex shapes based on player identity
