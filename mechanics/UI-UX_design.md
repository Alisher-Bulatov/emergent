# 🧩 UI/UX Design

## Overview

*Emergent*’s UI and UX are intentionally minimal, immersive, and symbolic—designed not as overlays on the experience, but as part of it. The interface breathes with the player’s emotions, responding to Clarity, Stress, and Echo like a living extension of the mind.

---

## 🌑 Design Philosophy

- **Diegetic First**: UI is integrated into the world whenever possible.
- **Emotional Feedback**: UI elements shift with internal state.
- **Non-Intrusive**: Minimal visual clutter, maximal symbolic clarity.
- **Narrative Fluidity**: Interface changes based on game phase, emotional resonance, and cycle depth.

## 📜 Onboarding Flow

| Phase         | Player Action              | UI Feedback                     |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Gaze Awakening | Focus on “First Thought”    | No UI—pure immersion             |
| Movement Unlocked | Begin walking branch     | Subtle path pulse, no HUD        |
| First Fragment | Absorb via gaze           | “+Clarity” flashes briefly       |
| Module Acquired | Orbital UI node appears   | Tooltip on hover (no tooltip spam) |
| Stress Spike   | Approaching intrusion      | Subtle red pulse, heartbeat audio |
| Synthesis      | Combine fragments          | CoreSelf pulses; UI ring activates |
| Death/Retreat | Intrusion collapse         | UI glitches or dissolves         |

## 📊 Emotional State HUD

- **Clarity** and **Stress** appear only during change.
- Echo effects: Ghost-layer UI flickers and distorted elements.
- CoreSelf emits light proportional to Clarity.
- Ambient sounds shift subtly with stress changes.

## 🌀 Core UI Elements

| Element         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Orbital Modules** | Float around CoreSelf. Represent abilities, upgrades, and stats. |
| **Context Ring** | Appears during synthesis or interaction moments. Rotates based on available actions. |
| **Emotional Vignettes** | Screen edges darken, brighten, or ripple subtly based on Stress/Clarity balance. |
| **Fragment Indicators** | Fragments emit harmonic tones, glow, or motion trails. No map icons. |

---

## 🧭 Navigation UI

- **No minimap**. Navigation is **symbolic**.
- **Fragment Resonance**: Distant fragments pulse when gaze aligns.
- **CoreSelf Trails**: Faint glowing lines suggest previously walked branches.
- **Zone Shifts**: UI color palette adapts to zone emotional tone.

---

## 🔁 Late Game UI Evolution

- UI becomes **less literal** and more abstract over time.
- **Fragment names scramble** at high Echo.
- **Stat displays distort** near death (glitchy font, reversed numbers).
- **Modules visually transform** as player evolves.
- **Endgame motif decay**: Interface forgets itself—menus dissolve.

---

## 🧠 Accessibility Options

- High contrast mode (solid colors instead of gradients).
- Audio subtitles for tone-based cues (e.g., “[rising dissonance]”).
- Optional simplified mode: static Clarity/Stress bars always visible.
- UI timing calibration (fade durations adjustable).

---

## 🎨 Visual Language

| Emotion | UI Behavior |
|--------|--------------|
| Calm   | Minimal glow, soft transitions |
| Fear   | Jagged lines, flicker pulses |
| Insight | Golden accents, radial bloom |
| Doubt  | UI doubles, mirror trails |
| Stress | Red-tinted HUD, heavy blur |

---

## 🧪 Diegetic UI Experiments

- **Fragment Tooltips** only appear when looked at for 2+ seconds.
- **Synthesis UI** built into CoreSelf ring—select fragments by orbit.
- **Anchor points** glow and pulse instead of button prompts.
- **Intrusion warning**: UI distortion begins *before* visual/audio.

---

## 🔮 Future Concepts

- **UI Memory Residue**: Old tooltips linger faintly, ghost-like.
- **Dynamic Thought Bubbles**: Narration appears as spatial thoughts, not text boxes.
- **Cycle Echo Markers**: Interface visually remembers past lives.

*In Emergent, the UI is not a layer between the player and the world—it is the world whispering back.*
