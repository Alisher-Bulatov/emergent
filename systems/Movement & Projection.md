# 🧭 Movement & Projection

## Overview

Movement in *Emergent* is a metaphor for agency—how far the self can stretch into unknowns. It evolves from rigid rails to fluid freedom as the player deepens their insight and emotional control.

---

## 🪢 Tethered Movement (Branches)

### Phase: 1–3

- Player moves along **preset Branches**.
- Movement is **forward/backward only**, like rails.
- Turning the camera shifts the direction of intent.
- No jumping, strafing, or free movement—early game emphasizes restriction.

> Symbolism: *You walk the path you’ve been given—until you learn to shape it.*

### Controls

- W/S or analog stick to move.
- Camera used for direction; no freeform lateral control.
- Movement speed: gentle walking pace to encourage reflection.

---

## 🌿 Branch Sculpting (See: Branch Sculpting.md)

- Unlocked in Phase 3.
- Allows players to grow new branches toward where they gaze.
- Expands traversable paths organically.

---

## 🧠 Projection: Free Consciousness Travel

### Phase: 5+

- Player unlocks the **Projection** ability—temporary detachment from Branches.
- Allows limited **free-floating exploration** within a tethered radius.

### Specs

| Parameter       | Default | Upgradable |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| Max Range      | 30m     | Yes (via Modules) |
| Duration       | 10 sec  | Yes        |
| Speed          | Medium glide | N/A      |

### Behavior

- Activated manually, toggles into ghost-like free-float state.
- Camera + movement controls operate in full 3D (6-DOF optional).
- When range or time expires, auto-snaps back to CoreSelf or nearest node.

> Visual: ethereal trail, mild distortion.  
> Audio: heartbeat slows, soft drone hums.

---

## 🔗 Tether Enforcement

- Always anchored to CoreSelf.
- Cannot exit maxProjectionRange.
- Crossing edge:
  - Movement halted or reversed.
  - Elastic force or hard boundary snap.

---

## 🧲 Reattachment & Anchor Logic

### Anchor Function

- Teleports CoreSelf to current location (if node is stable).
- Resets movement tether around new anchor.
- Only usable on stable nodes (e.g., branch tips or important loci).

### Use Cases

- Advance the “center” of the mindscape.
- Recover during Intrusions.
- Reset perspective for new Branch Sculpting.

---

## 🧱 Stability Constraints

- Projection disabled during:
  - Intrusions
  - Extremely high Stress
- Anchoring not possible on unstable ground (e.g., fragment midair).

---

## 🎨 Symbolic Resonance

| Mechanic       | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| Tethered Branches | Bound perception |
| Branch Sculpting | New pathways of thought |
| Projection | Curiosity beyond limits |
| Anchor | Re-centering identity |

Movement is a language in *Emergent*. You begin as thought, grow into intent, and eventually become the architect of your own direction.

## 🌌 Future Concepts

- **Branch Memory Trails**: Old paths linger as ghost lines.
- **Emotional Drift**: Projection pulls slightly toward unresolved fragments.
- **Zone-specific modifiers**: e.g., inverted gravity in Dream Fracture.

You are not just moving through the mind.  
**You are mapping its shape.**
