# ðŸŒ¿ Branch Sculpting

## Overview

Branch Sculpting is a core mechanic in *Emergent*, symbolizing the playerâ€™s growing agency within the mindscape. It allows the Consciousness to extend new pathsâ€”branchesâ€”by directing focus and intent. These branches are more than traversal mechanics; they are metaphors for forming new thoughts, possibilities, and connections.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay Mechanics

### Unlock Phase

- Becomes available in **Phase 3** of Cycle 1 (Insight Phase).
- Introduced narratively as the player's first active act of reshaping their inner world.

### Activation

- Activated by holding a specific input while looking in a direction.
- A branch visually grows from the **CoreSelf** or current **MindNode** toward the aimed direction.
- Solidifies into a traversable path, enabling new movement and exploration.

### Visual Feedback

- Grows as a glowing tendril of light.
- Curves organically, representing mental flow.
- Snaps to nearby fragments if applicable.

## ðŸ§  Technical Implementation (from Design Bible)

### Data Structure

- **MindNodes** represent fragment locations or memory loci.
- **BranchEdges** connect nodes and are rendered as curves.

### Sculpting Process

1. Identify the **current node context** (tip of branch or CoreSelf).
2. Determine **gaze direction**.
3. Project forward to find a **valid endpoint** (max length or snap to fragment).
4. Create new **MindNode** and mark stability if:
   - Itâ€™s max distance.
   - It holds a major fragment.
5. Create **BranchEdge** connecting nodes.
6. Render the branch.
7. Allow traversal from current position.

### Constraints

- Cannot sculpt during Intrusions or high stress.
- One active branch per node at a time (limits chaos).
- May require emotional calm to function.

## ðŸŒ€ Symbolic Significance

Branch Sculpting represents:

- **Cognitive expansion** â€“ forging new pathways of thought.
- **Agency** â€“ player asserting will over mindscape.
- **Reflection** â€“ branches are shaped by where you *choose* to look.
- **Memory seeking** â€“ drawn to fragments and buried insights.

It aligns with the gameâ€™s theme: *we shape the mind as we explore it.*

## ðŸ›  Design Tips

- Use it to reward curiosityâ€”hide rare fragments just out of reach.
- Pair with **Projection** for open traversal later in the game.
- Combine with **Anchor** to re-center CoreSelf at new discoveries.

## ðŸ§ª Future Enhancements

- Upgradeable branch range via **Modules**.
- Multiple branching styles (e.g., chaotic vs. focused).
- Emotional state affecting branch form: stressed branches flicker, calm ones glow.

Branch Sculpting is the playerâ€™s first taste of **true authorship** in *Emergent*. From following paths to forging them, this moment marks the mindâ€™s shift from passive reflection to creative becoming.
