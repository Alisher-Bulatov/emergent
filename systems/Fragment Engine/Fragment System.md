# ðŸ§  Fragment System

## Overview

Fragments are the primary collectible elements in *Emergent*, symbolizing thoughts, memories, emotions, and unresolved echoes of the self. They are the currency of growth, the seeds of chaos, and the puzzles of identityâ€”each one a mirror shard reflecting some part of the playerâ€™s evolving mind.

## ðŸŽ® Interaction Design

- **Absorb via Gaze**: Direct focus triggers collection.
- **Sound Feedback**: Each fragment type emits a signature tone.
- **Visual Feedback**: Absorption causes world ripple or light flare.

## ðŸŽ¨ Emotional Cues by Type

| Emotion | Color / Motion | Symbol |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Calm   | Blue/Green, slow pulse | Droplet / Wave |
| Fear   | Pale Violet, twitchy | Needle / Shard |
| Sorrow | Deep Purple, heavy glow | Teardrop |
| Anger  | Red/Orange, flicker-burst | Ember Core |
| Insight| Golden/White, radiant | Multifaceted crystal |

## ðŸ§ª Behavioral Variants

- **Fleeing**: Runs from stressed players
- **Haunting**: Orbits CoreSelf under high Echo
- **Decay**: Dissolves over time if ignored
- **Singing**: Emits chime when viewed with high Clarity
- **Mimicry**: Copies playerâ€™s movements
- **Duplicating**: In Dream Zones or under Projection

---

## ðŸ§  Collection Rules

- Fragments are **one-time collectibles**
- Each one changes the CoreSelf or environment
- Most fragments are **zone-themed**
- Some are hidden or require emotional state alignment

---

## ðŸ”„ Echo Buildup

- Collecting too many fragments without synthesis increases **Echo**
- High Echo triggers:
  - Stronger Intrusions
  - Visual/audio hallucinations
  - Emotional overload (UI distortion)

---

## ðŸ§¬ Symbolic Role

Fragments are the building blocks of identity.  
Each one asks: *Are you ready to hold this part of yourself?*

---

## ðŸ”® Future Extensions

- **Fragment Memories**: Replayable vignettes based on source
- **Fragment Chains**: Sequences that unlock special insights
- **Corrupted Fragments**: Risky, unstable, require cleansing

---

Collecting fragments is not about hoarding powerâ€”  
it is about *remembering who you are, one moment at a time*.
