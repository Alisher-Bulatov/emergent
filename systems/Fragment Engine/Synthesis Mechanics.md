# 🧬 Synthesis Mechanics

## Overview

Synthesis in *Emergent* is the act of integrating experience—where emotional fragments, memories, and contradictions fuse into new meaning. Mechanically, it's the game’s crafting system. Symbolically, it’s personal growth embodied.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

> "You are not what you collect. You are what you understand."

Synthesis transforms two (or more) Fragments into a new Module, Insight, or Ability, depending on emotional state, contextual resonance, and rarity.

---

## ⚙️ Synthesis Rules

### Basic Formula

```
[Fragment A] + [Fragment B]
→ [Outcome] if Emotional Requirement met
```

### Requirements

- **Fragment Compatibility**: Not all fragments combine.
- **Emotional State**: High Clarity, Low Stress, or specific Echo thresholds.
- **Location**: Most synthesis occurs at the **Core Sanctum**.

---

## 🎮 Interaction Flow

1. **Enter Core Sanctum**
2. **Activate Synthesis Ring**
3. **Select Two Fragments**
4. **Check Resonance Match**
5. **Confirm Emotional State**
6. **Trigger Synthesis Pulse**
7. **Observe Outcome**

## 🌟 Outcome Types

| Result Type     | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Module**       | Passive upgrades (Clarity+, Resilience, Insight trackers) |
| **Insight**      | New lore, altered perception, unlocks new fragments |
| **Ability**      | Unlocks actions (Shield, Anchor, Projection+) |
| **Meta-Synthesis** | Unique fusion of opposing emotions, triggers world changes |

---

## 🔮 Emotional Requirements

| Example Combo | Requirement | Outcome |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Pain + Calm | Clarity ≥ 50 | Resilience Module |
| Imagination + Doubt | Echo ≤ 30 | Possibility Bloom |
| Forgiveness + Rage | Clarity ≥ 70, Stress ≤ 20 | Catharsis Insight |
| Thoughtform + Echo | Echo ≥ 40 | Memory Loop Module |

---

## 🎇 Meta-Synthesis Events

Rare, high-stakes synthesis of polar-opposite fragments.

### Triggers

- Opposing emotions (Hope + Despair)
- Archetype alignment
- Unique zones or high Echo moments

### Results

- **World Shifts** (e.g., new zones bloom)
- **Narrative Branches**
- **Signature Modules** (e.g., Liberation Bloom, Truth Seed)

## 🧭 Visual & Audio Feedback

- Success: Mandala flash, harmonic resonance, clarity pulse
- Failure: Fragment flicker, no fusion, slight Echo gain
- Emotional mismatch: UI hint, delayed or corrupted synthesis

---

## 🧘 Reflection Design

Synthesis is not trial-and-error. It's introspection.

- **Clarity** reveals patterns.
- **Stress** clouds judgement.
- **Echo** demands resolution before deep insight.

---

## 🛠 Design Considerations

- First synthesis occurs in **Phase 3** (tutorialed gently)
- UI designed as orbiting ring of fragments
- No recipes shown—player discovers through emotion and logic
- Failure teaches, not punishes

---

## 🔮 Future Expansion

- **Three-fragment synthesis** in late game
- **Cycle-bound recipes** (available only under certain Archetypes)
- **Synthesis Journals**: Track past attempts and outcomes

---

You do not fuse fragments to gain power.  
You synthesize to *become whole*.
