# 🌪 Intrusion System

## Overview

Intrusions are *Emergent*'s manifestation of internal collapse. They occur when the mind's emotional equilibrium fails—when Stress overtakes Clarity, or Echo weighs too heavily. These moments are not enemies to defeat, but crises to endure, embodying the raw storm of emotional overwhelm.

---

## ⚠️ Trigger Conditions

### Primary Triggers

- **Stress ≥ Threshold** (usually 100)
- **Unstable Fragment Absorption** (e.g., Rage Core, Fear Seed)
- **Scripted Narrative Events**

### Modifiers

- **High Echo**: Increases intensity and duration.
- **Archetype**: Determines type and theme of intrusion.
- **Zone**: Alters form and environmental distortion.

> Pseudocode:  
> `if stress >= threshold and not intrusion_active: start_intrusion(...)`

## 🧟 Intrusion Forms

Each intrusion takes on a symbolic form tailored to player archetype and emotional state:

| Type        | Description | Common Archetypes |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Rage Tempest | Red storm, control inversion | Rebel, Catalyst |
| Isolation Swarm | Vanishing paths, fading sound | Guardian, Vessel |
| Echo Flood | Past fragment ghosts swarm CoreSelf | Warden, Weaver |
| Doubt Maze | Shifting paths, looping logic | Seeker, Dreamer |
| Grief Bloom | Slowed time, haunting whispers | Dreamer, Catalyst |

Each form manifests differently—through audio-visual distortion, control interference, and psychological stressors.

## 🎮 Gameplay Effects During Intrusion

### Environmental

- Distorted geometry, shifting colors, ambient collapse
- Fragments may disappear or become hostile

### Audio

- Dissonance, whisper loops, glitching memories
- Emotional tone matches intrusion type

### Control Impairment

- Input inversion
- Movement sluggishness or freezing
- Disorientation pulses

### Emotional Freeze

- Clarity/Stress changes suspended during intrusion
- Meditation locked out

---

## 🛡️ Player Tools & Strategy

### Defensive Abilities

- **Shield**: Reduces incoming strain, shortens intrusion duration
- **Anchor**: Teleports CoreSelf to safety if node is stable
- **Projection**: Temporarily escape danger (limited use)

> Timer reduction bonus for active use of defense abilities.

### Survival Goal

- Intrusions are **timed survival events**
- Player must endure until the emotional storm passes
- Success yields catharsis; failure yields collapse

---

## 🧘 Resolution Outcomes

### ✅ Success (Endurance)

- Stress halved
- Echo slightly reduced
- May drop a **Resilience Fragment**
- Intrusion-specific Insight chance (rare)

### ❌ Failure (Collapse)

- Teleport to last stable node
- Lose unsynthesized fragments (partial)
- Stress reset to 70% of threshold
- UI and world temporarily destabilized

---

## 🌌 Symbolic Significance

Intrusions represent:

- **Unintegrated turmoil**
- **Resistance to insight**
- **The price of avoidance**

They are not punishment—they are *revelations*, testing the structure of the self.

---

## 📈 Design Considerations

- First Intrusion scripted in Phase 4 to teach mechanics
- No two Intrusions are alike—context shapes form
- Players can “learn” from repeat intrusions (adaptive feedback)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Intrusion Echoes**: Afterimages or permanent scars
- **Intrusion Synthesis**: Rarely, surviving certain pairs may create unique Meta-Modules
- **Inner Voice Commentary**: Reactive narration during intrusions for reflection

---

Intrusions are *Emergent*’s dark mirror. They hold up what the player has suppressed, distorted, or delayed—and ask: **will you survive the storm, or become it?**
