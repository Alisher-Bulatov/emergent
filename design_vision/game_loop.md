# Game Loop

## 🔁 Overview

The gameplay loop in *Emergent* forms a symbolic, layered cycle:

**Explore → Absorb → Reflect → Synthesize → Evolve → Unlock → Repeat**

Each cycle deepens the player’s journey into symbolic zones, gathering fragments and evolving the CoreSelf.

---

## 🧭 Step 1: Explore the Mindscape

- Traverse surreal **symbolic zones**:  
  - *Mountains of Knowledge*, *Forest of Doubt*, *Sea of Longing*, *Maze of Reflection*, *Dream Fracture*, *Inversion Zone*
- Movement begins via **preset branches**, evolves to **Branch Sculpting** and **Projection**
- Navigation is emotional and metaphorical

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Absorb Mental Fragments

- Each zone offers unique fragments (e.g., Seeds of Doubt, Crystalized Knowledge)
- Fragments influence:
  - Emotional states (**Clarity**, **Stress**)
  - Provide **Modules** (permanent upgrades)

---

## 💠 Step 3: Manage Emotional State

- Balance **Clarity** and **Stress**
- Zones influence decay rates (e.g., Mountains reduce stress)
- Use **Meditation**, **zone synergy**, and **fragment sequencing**

---

## 🌪 Step 4: Face Intrusions

- High Stress triggers symbolic **Intrusions**
- Intrusion types vary by zone and player Archetype
- Intrusions represent inner breakdowns and challenges

---

## 🧬 Step 5: Synthesize and Evolve

- Combine fragments across zones to create rare modules
- Emotional alignment often required
- Example: Imagination + Doubt → Possibility Module

---

## 🌱 Step 6: Progress Deeper

- Unlock:
  - New symbolic zones
  - Evolved mechanics and environments
- The world grows increasingly abstract and responsive

---

## ♻️ Step 7: Cycle and Emerge Anew

- Mind resets with **new zone configuration**
- Changes reflect player choices
- Modules and Archetypes persist

---

## 🔄 Loop Summary

1. **Explore** symbolic domains  
2. **Absorb** unique fragments  
3. **Manage** emotional states  
4. **Face** intrusions  
5. **Synthesize** for growth  
6. **Evolve** into new terrain  
7. **Reset** with legacy intact

Each loop spirals inward toward greater coherence or deeper chaos.
