# Narrative Phases

The journey in *Emergent* unfolds through cyclical **narrative phases**, each symbolizing a stage of self-discovery. These phases operate both narratively and mechanically within each cycle of the game, introducing new gameplay elements while deepening emotional and symbolic progression.

The player begins as a formless **consciousness**—capable only of looking and interacting through gaze. The **CoreSelf**, a static and central symbol of identity, remains unmoving at the heart of the world. Over time, as the need for deeper exploration arises, the CoreSelf extends **branches of agency**, allowing the player to traverse the mindscape. Movement emerges first through guided threads of thought, then evolves into active **projection**, a cognitive ability that grows in power and flexibility.

---

## 🌑 Phase 1 – The Opening (Stillness and Awakening)

- Player exists as pure gaze—no form, no movement
- Player can interact with nearby mental objects through gaze-based focus
- A mysterious object appears: the "First Thought"
- Focusing gaze on it awakens the **CoreSelf**
- Initial fragments may be discovered and interacted with through proximity

---

## 🌱 Phase 2 – Necessity and Extension

- The CoreSelf senses something just beyond the player's gaze
- A glowing branch grows toward the new fragment—symbolizing a response to curiosity
- Player is gently nudged onto this branch, learning directional movement as a form of **intent-following**
- This phase emphasizes the link between curiosity, attention, and the growth of agency

---

## 💡 Phase 3 – Exploration and First Fragments

- Branch-based movement continues, enabling exploration of nearby zones
- More fragments are discovered and absorbed (e.g., “Calm Memory”)
- Emotional state HUD is revealed (Clarity, Stress)
- Player begins to notice how attention and decisions shape the mental world
- First **choice point** emerges via diverging branches

---

## 🌪 Phase 4 – Insight (Synthesis and Growth)

- Player unlocks **synthesis** inside the Core Sanctum
- Combining fragments forms powerful **Modules** that persist across cycles
- Emotional resonance becomes core to puzzle-solving and exploration
- The CoreSelf visually changes with the first synthesis event (e.g., glowing core, orbiting symbols)

---

## 🌪️ Phase 5 – Turmoil (Intrusions Begin)

- Emotional tension rises: **Intrusions** are introduced
- Triggered by imbalance (high Stress or fragmented clarity)
- Reality bends—zones shift, CoreSelf is visually disturbed (e.g., red cracks, distortions)
- Player must navigate symbolic threats using learned tools and awareness

---

## 🌌 Phase 6 – Expansive Mind (Open Exploration & Archetype)

- Player unlocks **mental projection**, detaching movement from fixed branches
- This cognitive skill allows free navigation and interaction at greater distances
- **Archetypes** emerge based on player's behavior patterns and synthesis history
- World becomes stranger, more symbolic, demanding deeper insight

---

## 🔚 Phase 7 – Finale (Climax and Transition)

- Final phase presents a symbolic confrontation or intricate reflective puzzle
- All systems converge: projection, synthesis, emotional balance, fragment memory
- CoreSelf may emit a pulse that triggers transition to:
  - A **new Cycle** (altered zones, preserved insights)
  - The **Final Cycle**, ending the player's journey with transcendence or collapse

---

## ♻️ Post-Phase Loop

After Phase 7, players begin a new Cycle with reshaped zones, retained Archetypes, and evolved cognitive abilities. 

The cycle spirals deeper each time—into **clarity**, **fragmentation**, or **integration**.
