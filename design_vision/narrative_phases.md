# Narrative Phases

The journey in *Emergent* unfolds through cyclical **narrative phases**, each symbolizing a stage of self-discovery. These phases operate both narratively and mechanically within each cycle of the game, introducing new gameplay elements while deepening emotional and symbolic progression.

The player begins as a formless **consciousness**—capable only of looking and interacting through gaze. The **CoreSelf**, a static and central symbol of identity, remains unmoving at the heart of the world. Over time, as the need for deeper exploration arises, the CoreSelf extends **branches of agency**, allowing the player to traverse the mindscape. Movement emerges first through guided threads of thought, then evolves into active **projection**, a cognitive ability that grows in power and flexibility.

---

## 🌑 Phase 1 – Emergence (Stillness and Synthesis)

- Player exists as pure gaze—no form, no movement.
- A few *mental objects* drift near the CoreSelf—remnants of forgotten memory or dormant intention.
- Gaze-based interaction with these objects awakens emotional resonances (e.g., Calm, Fear, Wonder).
- When a pattern emerges, **Synthesis** is triggered: fragments combine, forming the first **Module**.
- This Module unlocks the player's first **Cognitive Ability** (e.g., “Attune” or “Anchor”).
- The CoreSelf visually transforms (e.g., pulses with light, sprouts symbols, or begins to glow).

---

## 🌱 Phase 2 – Pull of the Unknown (Necessity and Extension)

- After Synthesis, the CoreSelf senses something beyond its range—a flicker of curiosity or imbalance.
- It extends a glowing **branch** toward the unknown—symbolizing inner growth responding to outer mystery.
- The player's consciousness is gently **pushed** onto this branch, learning to move in one direction.
- This phase introduces **intent-following** movement as a response to inner/emotional pull.

---

## 💡 Phase 3 – Exploration and Divergence

- Branch-based traversal continues, expanding into a small network of paths.
- The player discovers more **fragments** (e.g., “Calm Memory”, “Echo of Doubt”).
- The **Emotional State HUD** (Clarity, Stress) is introduced.
- Attention begins shaping the world—zones shift subtly with mood and memory alignment.
- First **choice point** emerges—branches diverge, each symbolically charged.

---

## 🌪 Phase 4 – Insight (Growth and Deeper Synthesis)

- Core Sanctum becomes accessible.
- More complex **Synthesis** is possible—combining multiple fragments for layered Modules.
- Modules now affect gameplay systems (e.g., memory retention, defense against Intrusions).
- The CoreSelf evolves visually and functionally based on synthesis history.

---

## 🌪️ Phase 5 – Turmoil (Intrusions Begin)

- Emotional instability increases—**Intrusions** are triggered by stress or imbalance.
- The world becomes volatile: distortions, haunting echoes, collapsing structures.
- The CoreSelf reacts physically (cracks, spasms, or flickers).
- Player must rely on cognitive abilities and fragments to navigate symbolic threats.

---

## 🌌 Phase 6 – Expansive Mind (Projection & Archetypes)

- Player unlocks **mental projection**—detaching movement from fixed branches.
- This new form of agency allows for free navigation, deeper interaction, and discovery.
- **Archetypes** emerge from accumulated actions, fragment combinations, and Module choices.
- The world reflects the player’s internal structure—dream logic dominates.

---

## 🔚 Phase 7 – Finale (Climax and Transition)

- Final phase presents a reflective confrontation or symbolic test.
- All systems converge: projection, synthesis, emotional balance, memory.
- CoreSelf emits a final **pulse**, leading to:
  - A **new Cycle** with preserved insights
  - The **Final Cycle**—a singular ending shaped by clarity, collapse, or transcendence

---

## ♻️ Post-Phase Loop

After Phase 7, players begin a new Cycle with reshaped zones, retained Archetypes, and evolved cognitive abilities.

Each loop spirals deeper—toward **clarity**, **fragmentation**, or **integration**.
