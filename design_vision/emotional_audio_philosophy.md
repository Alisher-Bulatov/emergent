# Emotional Audio Philosophy

**Design Principle:**  
*Sound is the voice of the self—truth leaks through tone before thought.*

Audio in *Emergent* is not a background layer—it is a core symbolic element of the player’s emotional journey. Every tone, glitch, harmony, or silence mirrors internal states.

## 🎼 Emotional Fidelity

- Music dynamically reflects **Clarity**, **Stress**, and **Echo** levels.
- Each **Zone** has a unique emotional scale:
  - *Mountains of Knowledge*: harmonic ascent
  - *Forest of Doubt*: whispering ambivalence
  - *Sea of Longing*: slow, distant echoes
  - *Dream Fracture*: chaotic, unstable tones
  - *Inversion Zone*: reversed or atonal motifs
- Music swells or deteriorates based on the player’s mental state.

## 🔊 Diegetic Sound Cues

- **Fragments** emit harmonics tied to their emotional polarity:
  - Calm: soft, bell-like tones
  - Fear: tremors and irregular pulses
  - Insight: crystalline clarity chimes
- **Stress** creates distortion layers—reversed ambiences, detuned drones.
- **Echo** adds ghost layers—barely audible whispers or looping motifs.

---

## ⚠️ Intrusion Audio Logic

- Intrusions begin **sonically** before visual effects emerge.
- Cues include:
  - Static pulses
  - Dissonant chants
  - Rhythmic distortion (e.g., heartbeat, footsteps, tremors)
- Each Archetype might experience different tonal triggers.
- Audio impairment is part of disorientation (e.g., desync, pitch drift).

## 🧠 Final Cycle Soundscape

- As the **Final Cycle** nears:
  - Music fragments, loops unpredictably
  - Themes forget themselves
  - Familiar motifs return as eerie echoes
- Endings receive distinct audio treatment:
  - **Liberation**: silence, then harmonic bloom
  - **Fracture**: glitchcore collapse into noise
  - **Reunion**: full motif resolution, ascending chorus

## 💬 Design Mantra

> *“The player may not always understand what they feel—  
but the sound will always know.”*

Use audio not just to accompany, but to **reveal**.

Let the sound *be* the subconscious.
