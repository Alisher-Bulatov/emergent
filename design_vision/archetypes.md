# Archetype Index

# ðŸ§  Intent Archetype Index â€“ Emergent

This document consolidates all Archetype-related logic and symbolic meaning into a single, reusable reference.

## ðŸŒŸ Archetype Overview

**Purpose:** Reflect the playerâ€™s behavioral, emotional, and synthesis patterns. Shapes narrative tone, fragments encountered, and Final Cycle outcomes.

**Revealed:** Midway through Cycle 1 (typically Phase 5).

**Persistence:** Carries across cycles; may evolve based on sustained player behavior.

---

## ðŸ§­ Archetype Determination Criteria

- **Fragment Absorption Patterns**
- **Synthesis Tendencies** (risk-taking, polarity fusion)
- **Emotional Trends** (Clarity, Stress, Echo)
- **Zone Affinities**
- **Intrusion Response Patterns**
- **Retreats vs Perseverance**

## ðŸ”® Archetype List (Expanded Set)

| Archetype | Behavior Profile | Narrative Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Seeker | High exploration, cross-zone synthesis | Curious wanderer |
| Guardian | Empathetic, protective, low stress | Emotional shield |
| Rebel | Aggressive, high stress tolerance | Chaotic challenger |
| Dreamer | Subconscious affinity, surreal logic | Mindshaper |
| Warden | Manages Echo deliberately | Memory archivist |
| Weaver | Seeks synthesis through contrast | Harmonizer of paradox |
| Vessel | Collects but rarely synthesizes | Mirror of unprocessed self |
| Catalyst | High Meta-Synthesis rate | Force of insight and transformation |

## ðŸŒ€ Final Cycle Influence

Archetypes impact the outcome of the Final Cycle. Sample logic:

```python
if Echo > 75 and Archetype consistency < 50:
    ending = "Fracture"elif BurdenFragments > InsightFragments:
    ending = "Wither"elif MetaSyntheses >= 3 and Clarity > 100:
    ending = "Liberation"elif Archetype consistency >= 75:
    ending = "Reunion"else:
    ending = "Ambiguous Becoming"
```

## ðŸŽ­ Narrative Application

- Intrusions evolve to reflect archetype-specific fears or flaws.
- NPCs and inner voices refer to the player by Archetype.
- Some fragments are archetype-aligned and only appear under certain profiles.
- Module bonuses may reflect Archetype traits (e.g., Seeker = insight boost).

---

## ðŸŒ€ Notes on Archetype Shifts

- Archetypes can evolve across cycles.
- Drastic changes in behavior may result in:
    - **Hybrid archetypes**
    - **Regression** (if Echo dominates)
    - **Transcendence** (if Meta-Synthesis spikes)
