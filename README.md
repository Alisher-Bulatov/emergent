# Emergent

*Emergent* is a symbolic, introspective roguelike built in Unity that explores evolving consciousness through interactive memory fragments, surreal terrain, and emotional clarity. This project is a love letter to personal growth, philosophical exploration, and procedural storytelling.

## Core Concept

At the heart of Emergent lies the **CoreSelf**, a pulsating, sentient presence navigating a boundless mindscape. The player interacts with symbolic **Mental Objects**, **Intrusions**, and **Fragments**—each representing facets of memory, emotion, and identity.

Gameplay revolves around:

- **Growth of Agency** – Movement and skills are earned, not given.
- **Symbolic Interaction** – Each choice is a reflection of thought—resurface, suppress, or transform.
- **Procedural Introspection** – Dynamic environments mirror the player's internal state.

## Player Agency

In *Emergent*, the player embodies a formless consciousness—an unseen presence drifting within the surreal mindscape. The **CoreSelf** serves as a symbolic entity within this world, representing the evolving state of identity, emotion, and insight. This distinction is critical to the philosophical and emotional framing of the game.

### Forms of Agency

1. **Gaze and Observation** – Initially, interaction is limited to observing fragments, studying connections, and understanding the environment through focused awareness.

2. **Will Projection** – As the game progresses, the player gains the ability to influence the world by projecting intent, allowing for manipulation of objects and navigation through the mindscape.

3. **Resonance and Synthesis** – Deeper into the journey, the player can merge fragments, resolve intrusions, and reshape the mental landscape, facilitating profound transformations within the CoreSelf.

This layered approach to player agency encourages introspection and mirrors the process of personal growth and self-discovery.
