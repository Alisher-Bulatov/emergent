# 🌌 Emergent

**Emergent** is a symbolic, introspective roguelike built in Unity that explores evolving consciousness through interactive memory fragments, surreal terrain, and emotional clarity. This project is a love letter to personal growth, philosophical exploration, and procedural storytelling.

## 🧠 Core Concept

At the heart of Emergent lies the **CoreSelf**, a pulsating, sentient presence navigating a boundless mindscape. The player interacts with symbolic **Mental Objects**, **Intrusions**, and **Fragments**—each representing facets of memory, emotion, and identity.

Gameplay revolves around:

- 🌱 **Growth of Agency**: Movement and skills are earned, not given.
- 🧩 **Symbolic Interaction**: Each choice is a reflection of thought—resurface, reassess, let go.
- 💡 **Emotional Feedback**: The world reacts with light, sound, and distortion.
- 🔁 **Cycle-Based Evolution**: Life is lived in loops; each death, a transformation.

## 🔧 Current Status

This repository currently contains:

- Design documentation
- Lore fragments
- Pseudocode structures
- Playtest notes and system drafts

The full Unity implementation is **in progress**. Code, shaders, and gameplay systems will be added as development evolves.
