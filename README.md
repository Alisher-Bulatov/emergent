# üß† Emergent ‚Äì Modular Design Archive

Welcome to the modular documentation for **Emergent**, a symbolic, introspective puzzle-adventure set within a surreal mindscape. This repository contains all design, implementation, and narrative modules organized for clarity, scalability, and collaborative iteration.

## üõ† Usage

Each file in this repository is standalone but designed to interlink symbolically and mechanically. You can:

- Build prototype systems from files in `/systems/`  
- Design levels or fragments using `/vision/` and `/lore/`  
- Tune progression and challenge logic using `/procedural/`  
- Customize onboarding and feedback from `/interface/`

## üîÑ Contributing

If you are contributing to this project, please:

- Use meaningful commit messages  
- Keep each file atomic and scoped  
- Link new additions in this `README.md` under the correct category

## üìå Notes

- Game engine: **Unity (URP)**  
- Shader/FX: Shader Graph  
- Input: Gaze-based + WASD  
- Interaction: Context-sensitive floating UI + symbolic logic
