# Cognitive abilities Overview

Mental Abilities in *Emergent* are tools of self-awareness, symbolic interaction, and emotional transformation. They are grouped into three categories based on how they function within the mind:

---

## ðŸ§  Cognitive abilities (Active)

These are intentional actions the player can take to interact with mental objects, modify internal states, or navigate cognitive space.

| Skill Name      | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Attune          | Sync with the emotional resonance of a nearby mental object, enabling deeper interaction. |
| Analyze         | Break down a mental object into symbolic components, revealing hidden properties. |
| Let Go          | Consciously release an object or attachment, creating space in the mind. |
| Trace Memory    | Visually reconstruct your path through the mind, showing prior decisions and consequences. |
| Synthesize      | Combine two or more compatible mental objects into a new insight or ability. |
| Reflect         | Temporarily pause the flow of time to observe and evaluate mental dynamics. |

## ðŸ§© Protocols (Passive)

Protocols are passive cognitive patternsâ€”habits, beliefs, or subconscious filters that shape perception and interaction.

| Protocol Name       | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Emotional Buffering | Reduces the corruption caused by emotional intrusions. |
| Pattern Anticipation| Highlights subtle cues about potential future states or outcomes. |
| Cognitive Elasticity| Increases recovery speed after Fragment loss or emotional destabilization. |
| Inner Firewall       | Automatically weakens harmful intrusive thoughts before they reach the CoreSelf. |

## ðŸ§µ Threads (Relational Links)

Threads are intentional or emergent connections between mental objects. They influence how objects evolve, interact, or resonate together.

| Thread Type          | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Thread of Forgiveness| Binds painful memories together, reducing their corruption over time. |
| Thread of Longing    | Maintains a connection with distant or unreachable fragments. |
| Thread of Duality    | Links contradictory objects in tension, potentially unlocking paradox synthesis. |
| Thread of Theme      | Connects fragments sharing symbolic resonance, increasing synthesis potential. |

*Threads can break, evolve, or transform based on your actions, emotional state, or Protocols.*

## ðŸ§  Integration with Archetypes

Certain Intent Archetypes influence how you acquire or wield abilities:
- The Weaver starts with a Thread.
- The Architect unlocks more Protocol slots.
- The Analyst gains earlier access to reflection-based skills.

All mental abilities evolve alongside your consciousness.
