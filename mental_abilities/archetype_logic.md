# 🧬 Archetype Logic System

## Overview

The Archetype Logic System governs how player identity shapes each cycle of Emergent. Archetypes are not chosen—they are inferred from player behavior, synthesis outcomes, and emotional response patterns. They dynamically shift over time, subtly altering the shape of the world.

## 📊 Inference System

### Data Points Tracked

- Fragment selection trends
- Emotional state history (Clarity, Stress, Echo)
- Intrusion handling behavior
- Module installation priorities
- Branching decisions and anchor frequency

### Archetype Update Cycle

- Recalculated at the **end of each cycle**
- Fades old data over time (emotional memory decay)
- Allows Archetype Drift (player can change over time)
