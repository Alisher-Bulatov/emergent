# Player Agency in *Emergent*

## Overview

In *Emergent*, the player does **not** embody the CoreSelf.

Instead, the player is a **formless consciousness**—an unseen presence, a drifting awareness within the surreal mindscape. The CoreSelf is a **symbolic object within the world**, representing the evolving state of identity, emotion, and insight. It is **visible, reactive, and central**, but not the player themselves.

This distinction is critical to the philosophical and emotional framing of the game.

## Player Identity

**The player is:**
- A disembodied observer.
- Capable of intention, focus, and interaction.
- Not bound to a fixed location or identity.
- Existing between fragments, thoughts, and intrusions.

**The CoreSelf is:**
- A visual and symbolic representation of mental structure.
- Anchored in the world.
- Affected by actions, interactions, and trauma.
- Not directly controlled, but influenced.

## Forms of Agency

### 1. **Gaze and Observation**
- The primary interface at the start.
- The player can look around, study fragments, observe connections.
- Some interactions happen through **focused awareness** (gaze duration, proximity of will).

### 2. **Will Projection**
- The player gradually gains the ability to **project threads of intention**.
- These may manifest as neuron-like tendrils, light paths, or temporary avatar nodes (e.g., "WillNode").
- Used to activate fragments, trigger skills, or extend agency.

### 3. **Agency Growth**
- Movement, influence, and impact increase over time.
- Agency unlocks symbolically—e.g., curiosity unlocking forward movement.
- Entire playthroughs can focus on passive reflection or active shaping.

## Gameplay Implications

- **Camera Perspective**: Floating, third-person, or abstracted, never anchored to the CoreSelf.
- **Input System**: Interactions are based on focus, intention, emotional state—not direct physical control.
- **UI Design**: Minimal, diegetic, reflecting awareness rather than stats.

---

## Symbolic Framing

- The CoreSelf is the **mirror**, the **anchor**, the **artifact of becoming**.
- The player is the **wind**, the **spark**, the **presence behind the mirror**.
- Death is not failure—it is **transition**, **reflection**, or **release**.

---

## Implementation Notes

- Consider separating CoreSelf and PlayerMind as distinct entities in Unity.
- Use event systems or ScriptableObjects to let the player “influence” the CoreSelf indirectly.
- Design camera and feedback systems to emphasize detachment and reflection.

## Summary

The player is not the hero.  
The player is the **awareness of the hero**, the **space in which change occurs**.

*Emergent* is not about what you are. It is about what you witness, and what you shape without ever fully becoming.
