### 🕊 Cycle Transitions & Endgame States

Each cycle ends not with victory, but transformation. There are three possible closure types:

---

#### 🔁 Completion: Insightful Continuation

- **Trigger**: Final Phase completed, CoreSelf synthesizes an ultimate fragment.  
- **Narrative**: The mind evolves—shedding its current form.  
- **Result**: Next cycle begins with reshaped zones, Archetype advancement, and inherited modules.  
- **Visual**: The CoreSelf bursts into fractal bloom. Light spirals inward before a fade to black.

---

#### 🌑 Collapse: Emotional Overload

- **Trigger**: Echo maxes out or Stress reaches a fatal peak.  
- **Narrative**: The mind shatters under unresolved tension.  
- **Result**: Fragments lost, zones destabilized next cycle, Archetype regression or distortion.  
- **Visual**: UI glitches, dark vines entangle the CoreSelf, followed by abrupt silence.

---

#### 🧘‍♂️ Voluntary Retreat: Withdrawal by Will

- **Trigger**: Player chooses to end a run from Core Sanctum.  
- **Narrative**: A conscious pause, choosing reflection over further pursuit.  
- **Result**: No loss of modules, but Echo crystallizes into a "Burden Fragment" carried into the next run.  
- **Visual**: World slows. All sounds dim. CoreSelf pulses once and contracts.

### 🌟 Endgame (Final Cycle)

In the final cycle, the mind’s structure becomes unstable. Zones collapse into each other. Fragment behavior becomes volatile. The player's choices across all runs converge:

- Final Synthesis triggers one of several symbolic endings:  
  - **Reunion** – Consciousness merges with CoreSelf.  
  - **Fracture** – Self is lost to chaos, birthing a new identity.  
  - **Liberation** – The self dissolves entirely—freedom from identity.

The final decision is not presented as a choice, but emerges from the player’s entire journey.

### 🧩 Final Cycle Determinants: Emergent Logic for Closure

The Final Cycle is not simply a level—it is a culmination. Its structure, tone, and potential outcomes are shaped dynamically based on the player's entire journey. The logic of the Final Cycle depends on four interlocking determinants:

#### 1\. **Archetype Consistency**

- The system tracks how strongly the player has embodied their dominant Archetype across cycles.  
- Players who frequently align with their Archetype unlock more coherent endings (e.g., "Liberation" or "Reunion").  
- Inconsistency results in fragmented or ambiguous resolutions.

#### 2\. **Emotional Footprint**

- Clarity, Stress, and Echo trends over the entire game create a psychological map.  
- Low Clarity and high Echo may tilt the ending toward *Fracture*, while high Clarity and stable Echo favor *Integration* or *Insight* endings.

#### 3\. **Synthesis Profile**

- Tracks how often and how deeply the player engaged with synthesis.  
- Meta-Synthesis events weigh heavily—each one tilts the final synthesis toward greater symbolic resonance.  
- Failing to synthesize critical opposing fragments may result in unresolved outcomes.

#### 4\. **Burden & Insight Fragments Carried**

- Voluntary Retreats turn Echo into crystallized "Burden Fragments" which reappear in the Final Cycle.  
- If the player brings more Insights than Burdens, the world bends toward clarity.  
- Too many Burdens distort the mindscape irreversibly.

**Final Cycle Algorithm Summary:**

if Echo \> 75 and Archetype consistency \< 50:

ending \\= "Fracture"

elif BurdenFragments \> InsightFragments:

ending \\= "Wither"

elif MetaSyntheses \>= 3 and Clarity \> 100:

ending \\= "Liberation"

elif Archetype consistency \>= 75:

ending \\= "Reunion"

else:

ending \\= "Ambiguous Becoming"
